Installation
===============================================================================

Copy the files into a directory of your liking; it doesn't have to be anywhere
near your Unreal Tournament directory.

Info
===============================================================================

If you're using your own favorite text editor for UnrealScript development,
you're bound to use "ucc make" manually to compile your scripts. Doing so
involves a big bunch of small steps, some of which have to be repeated every
time you want to recompile.


Compile
=======

UMake wraps that call to "ucc make" and everything else that's involved in
compiling an UnrealScript project in a neat, straightforward graphical user
interface.

All you have to do to compile a project is dropping an UnrealScript source file
or project directory on the UMake icon (on your desktop, for instance). UMake
automatically takes care of adding an EditPackages line, creating a backup of
and deleting the original package file and running "ucc make" afterwards. If an
error occurs, UMake restores the backup file and displays a the raw compiler
error message along with a comprehensible explanation of it.

UMake also warns you if you attempt to compile a project that seems to be up to
date already and lets you cancel the compilation before it starts. In addition,
you can abort the compilation process in progress whenever you like; UMake
automatically restores the last valid version of your package then.


Integrate
=========

UMake provides a whole bunch of integration options for your system and your
favorite text editor. If you like, you can have UMake create an UnrealScript
file drop target icon on your desktop and right-click menu extensions for
Explorer to directly compile any project you like.

If your text editor supports it, you can set it up to launch UMake at the press
of a keyboard shortcut or a toolbar button. If a compilation error occurs,
UMake provides an "Edit" button that takes you back to the very line and source
file that caused the problem (if you configure UMake that way).
